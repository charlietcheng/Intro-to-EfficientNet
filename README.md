# Intro to EfficientNet
By Charlie Cheng, Ethan Qiu, Yuexi Shen, Siqi Zhu

* This is our final project for the course [CS 182/282A: Deep Neural Networks](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs182/sp23/) at UC Berkeley.

This is an introductory tutorial to [EfficientNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11946), a family of convolutional neural networks that have achieved state-of-the-art performance on image classification tasks. We designed various conceptual questions, including the intuition on compound scaling, stochastic depth training, squeeze & excitation, and more. We also implemented a PyTorch version of EfficientNet and trained it on the [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) dataset. We hope this tutorial can help you understand the EfficientNet paper and its implementation better.
